# Zia Bakery

Welcome to the Zia Bakery website!

This is the first web project that I built using React, while building this website I learned a lot about React concepts ranging from props, components, hooks and others. 

And it turns out that React is a technology that suits me, because with React I can build web applications more dynamically.
Next time I will learn more about React and its ecosystem.

**Tech Stack:**
- React (Library JavaScript)
- Tailwind (Framework CSS)
- Framer Motion (Library for React Animation)
